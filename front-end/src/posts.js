      "Just a week after returning from Colombia, a close friend called and asked if I wanted to move to China with him. Even though I basically hadn’t even unpacked, I told him I was down. His sister had gone to China years before with a non-profit group called ILP and recommended the experience. We applied to the program and were accepted to the same city to teach English at a boarding school called QingYing Foreign Language School in Changzhou. Changzhou lies about halfway between Shanghai and Nanjing, meaning it’s about halfway up the coast and a couple hours inland. We met between classes at the University to open the email where it said we would go, spent a minute looking at things in the city, then went to class. We were very excited.",
      "My parents both speak Spanish, and I was given a lot of exposure growing up. However, I never really cared much, and ended up getting a D- in Spanish in 8th grade. Since such a low grade didn’t advance me to the next level, I chose to take Chinese in high school instead. My teacher grew up in China and was a school teacher there. Her teaching style was difficult for me, but I loved the class. I took Chinese for three years, missing the fourth year because we had moved out of the country for the first semester. I loved Chinese, and I still dream about speaking it fluently. My friend took a Chinese calligraphy class the summer before we went, and we were both excited beyond anything to finally get there.",
      "I had almost 80 students between ages 5-10 that I would see in groups of about 10 for 25 minutes each. These students didn’t hardly know any English, mostly because they were young and hadn’t had much study. There were other teachers with older and more fluent students, but my friend and I both scored with the high energy and low discipline first and second graders. However, we didn’t really go to teach. While we spent our weekdays with the students, our weekends were our’s. We’d often leave Friday right after our last class, then return as late as Monday morning just before our first class. During national holidays we went further out, but often we just stayed within a few hours of Changzhou. During my five months, I started in Shenzhen then went to Huangshan, Guilin, Yangshuo, Wudangshan, Xian, Beijing, Shanghai, and Changzhou, finally settling in at the school. Then, with Changzhou as my home base, I went to Suzhou (a number of times), Shanghai (a few times), Yangshuo (again), Guilin (again), Zhangjiajie, Nanjing (twice), Huangshan (again), and Beijing (again).",

      "You may not always choose when, where, or how. I didn’t choose to go to Colombia, but I chose to go somewhere. Before graduating high school, I applied to serve a mission for my church. The day I graduated I opened the announcement for where I would serve. Knowing a little Spanish (and having failed Spanish), I mispronounced “Medellín” as soon as I saw it. I’ll always blame that on the missing accent over the 'i'. The Church gave me almost five months to prepare, so I went ahead and started college.",
      "I studied thee years of Chinese in high school and failed a year of Spanish in middle school, but maybe the Church figured my time in Peru was good preparation. Either way, we believe the assignments are inspired, so possibly there was no human logic involved. Maybe it was all my childhood exposure to Spanish, or the time spend not understanding anyone in Peru, or maybe divine intervention, but once the plane landed in Bogotá, I felt like I could speak Spanish. I acted as translator between the bus driver and the other four English-speaking missionaries on our way to the Missionary Training Center (CCM in Spanish) where we would be taught Spanish. This was six weeks pretty cooped up with an intensive language study schedule from our first class at 8am to our last class at 8pm.",
      "During my 24 months in Colombia, I made it to Bogota, Envigado, Medellin, Itagui, Belen, Sabaneta, Monteria, Cerete, Lorica, Armenia, Calarca, San Pelayo, Pereira, Dos Quebradas, Santa Rosa, Sevilla, and surely more. I remember transferring my area of operations from Envigado to Cerete, nearly eleven hours in bus, then to Armenia for another 15 hours, then Monteria, another 15 hours, then to Dos Quebradas, about another 12 hours. Through the whole period, a focus was on learning the culture and language. I spend all day in the houses of locals or on the streets between houses of locals. Unlike my time in China, traveling was kept pretty minimal. We didn’t make trips except either on Monday’s or to travel to someone’s house far away. My first visit to San Pelayo was after walking more than two hours from Cerete. All the other trips were on Jeep once we learned better.",

      "After my parents spent considerable time in Guatemala, Uruguay, and Mexico, they decided they wanted to go back. Then spent year serving in South America and felt like they could do more. After a corporate reorganization nixed my Dad’s transfer to South America when I was young, they were left to figure something out on my own. It finally came together for my senior year of high school. They found an organization called Eagle Condor that agreed to accommodate an entire family during their humanitarian program. This meant we took an entire facility meant for at least six students and made it our home.",
      "My parents quickly got callings in the deteriorating ward, we found that one of the missionaries in the ward was related to a family in our stake, I was asked to explain auto mechanics to the young men and to home teach with the young men’s president, and we all quickly adjusted to the new lifestyle. Soon, we had the bus schedule and paths memorized, some of us were on the local swim team, and we already hated the cafeteria food. We had favorite restaurants, favorite street vendors, and desks and shelving in our rooms. For a few hours every afternoon, we would feed lunch to the children, then help them with homework, teach classes, and generally entertain them. This was sometimes their only meal in the day, and once they went home, they’d be helping in the fields.",
      "During our five months, we made it to Lima, Cajamarca, Llacanora, Cumbemayo, Puyllucana, Banos del Inca, Chiclayo, Trujillo, and Cuzco. We taught and baptized a school teacher who would travel more than eight hours to make it to church every Sunday, would eat lunch with us, then travel back. She was finally transferred to Llacanora, where it was a much shorter trip to Church. I competed in an inter-city swim meet for the local team and won three gold medals and one silver (by .01 seconds). At the same time, my older brother was serving his mission in Lima. We met some of his converts and companions, and even met with his mission president. We ended up going to the Temple on the same day, but missed each other by a couple hours.",
